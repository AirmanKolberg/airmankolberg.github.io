              <h3> <a href="https://github.com/AirmanKolberg/ADA-Minting-Calculator">Last ADA Minted Calculator</a> </h3>
              <p>
                As a long-time investor in Cardano/ADA, I one day found myself wondering
                how long it will take for the 45 billionth, and final ADA to be minted
                through staking (as the blockchain is a Proof-of-Stake network).  Despite
                searching the web for a while for an answer, I found none.  So, I decided
                to utilise a cryptocurrency data API called "cryptocompare", and create
                a series of bots with the following functions:
                <br><br>

                <b>1. Data Collection </b>- Collect the supply data for ADA every 20min, 24/7,
                and save the data to a local database (this database is shared in the GitHub
                link/app name). <br>
                <b>2. Backend Calculations </b>>- Compare the change in ADA supply over time by
                calculating the average amount of ADA added to the network per minute, and
                assess how this number changes over time, if at all. <br>
                <b>3. Forcast/Predictive Modelling </b>- Extrapolate this data over time (with any
                changes over time, if detected) to determine the approximate time/date that
                the final ADA will be minted. <br><br>

                As more data is collected, this application should, in theory, become more
                accurate over time in its forecast modelling.
