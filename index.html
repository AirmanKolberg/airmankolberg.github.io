                A Flash game I wrote in ActionScript 2.0 ten years ago.  It's an object-oriented
                game that teaches you fun cat facts whilst you try to keep a laser pointer away
                from a tabby cat.  All of the animations, code, music, and sound effects, were 
                done by me in 2011.

                Using BeautifulSoup to assist with webscraping, I devised an application that
                can keep an eye out for courses that have no seats left day and night, so that
                the moment a spot is available, you can snag it before another student.  This
                kind of thing could come in handy, especially if you're an ASU student.

                that will gamble for you and distribute it on the web for free.

                A Swift application that I had to finish in Python (due to my
                MacBook's old age and inability to handle XCode anymore) that
                allows you to record fishing data (time, date, location, fish
                caught, etc.) to later be interpreted to predict the best locations
                to find certain fish species.<br><br>I plan to use this to someday catch
                a bluefin tuna.  Not to sell, just as a bucket list checkpoint.

              <h3> <a href="https://github.com/AirmanKolberg/ADA-Minting-Calculator">Last ADA Minted Calculator</a> </h3>
              <p>
                As a long-time investor in Cardano/ADA, I one day found myself wondering
                how long it will take for the 45 billionth, and final ADA to be minted
                through staking (as the blockchain is a Proof-of-Stake network).  Despite
                searching the web for a while for an answer, I found none.  So, I decided
                to utilise a cryptocurrency data API called "cryptocompare", and create
                a series of bots with the following functions:
                <br><br>

                <b>1. Data Collection </b> - Collect the supply data for ADA every 20min, 24/7,
                and save the data to a local database (this database is shared in the GitHub
                link/app name). <br>
                <b>2. Backend Calculations </b> - Compare the change in ADA supply over time by
                calculating the average amount of ADA added to the network per minute, and
                assess how this number changes over time, if at all. <br>
                <b>3. Forcast/Predictive Modelling </b> - Extrapolate this data over time (with any
                changes over time, if detected) to determine the approximate time/date that
                the final ADA will be minted. <br><br>

                As more data is collected, this application should, in theory, become more
                accurate over time in its forecast modelling.

              <h3> <a href="https://github.com/AirmanKolberg/Budget-Bugger-IO">Budget_Bugger.io</a> </h3>
              <p>
                This app was both a personal finance solution, as well as a project based on the
                request of my fianc√©e.  Budget Bugger is a personal finance app that I built
                because I had used a lot of finance apps over the years, but they never really
                functioned the way that I wanted them to function.  So I created Budget Bugger,
                originally a CLI application written in Python/Flask that kept track of all of
                our bank accounts, alerted us with potentially fraudulent charges, and it also
                kept track of the rate of change of incoming/outgoing expenses over time to give
                us a more accurate, and as I like to say, "more difficult to mentally argue with"
                backend logic that gave us a more realistic idea of where our money was going, and
                what our actual net worth is at any given time. <br><br>

                My fianc√©e became quite fond of the app, but though she is not an old-school CS
                geek like me who picks CLI over GUI any day, I decided to completely re-write the
                app and give it a GUI design with an easy-to-control panel arrangement.  The application's
                backend is still written in Python3/Flask, however I had to utilise some HTML/CSS/JS
                a bit as well to 'spiff up' the front-end.  All-in-all, a very useful, fun, and handy
                application to have, I've discovered.
